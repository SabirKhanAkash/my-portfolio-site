I have used `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, [`Vanila-tilt.js`](https://micku7zu.github.io/vanilla-tilt.js/), [`Particles.js`](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/) to build the site and for the deployment [`Vercel`](https://vercel.com/) was used primarily and [`Netlify`](https://www.netlify.com/) was used as a mirror site. THANK YOU.
